*my project story*
I was very proud I was able to get my MVP done on Wednesday and i thought i would have Thursday to make it look
good then on Thursday i had trouble uploading to huroku and i tried to add another an update feature that did not
work and then broke my code. so trying to fix that took all day so i was not able to add more styling features. 
and my update feature still dose not work. 
I was very surprised and excited of what i was able to create and i am excited to keep learning.
